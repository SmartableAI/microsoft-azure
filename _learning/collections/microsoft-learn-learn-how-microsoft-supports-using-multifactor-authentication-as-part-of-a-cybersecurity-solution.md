title: "Learn how Microsoft supports using multifactor authentication as part of a cybersecurity solution"
excerpt: "Multifactor authentication helps secure your environment and resources by requiring that your users confirm their identity by using multiple authentication methods, like a phone call, text message, mobile app notification, or one-time password. You can use multifactor authentication both on-premises and in the cloud to add security for accessing Microsoft online services, remote access applications, and more. This learning path provides an overview of how to use multifactor authentication as part of a cybersecurity solution.The deadline for agencies to adopt multifactor authentication and encryption at rest and in transit to the maximum extent (and report on progress every 60 days), per Section 3 of the Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, is **November 8, 2021**."
