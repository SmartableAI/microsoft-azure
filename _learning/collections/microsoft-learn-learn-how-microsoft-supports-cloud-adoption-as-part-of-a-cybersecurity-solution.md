title: "Learn how Microsoft supports cloud adoption as part of a cybersecurity solution"
excerpt: "The cloud fundamentally changes everything. Traditionally, ownership and responsibility for all aspects of the technology you use, from infrastructure to software, has fallen to enterprises. When you move to the cloud, you can instead provision and consume just the resources you need, when you need them. Although the cloud offers tremendous flexibility, to get the most benefit out of your move to the cloud, you need a proven and consistent methodology for adopting cloud technologies. The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure meets that need, helping guide decisions throughout cloud adoption. This learning path provides an overview of the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure and how to use it as part of a cybersecurity solution.The deadline for agencies to update plans for federal network infrastructure, including adoption of cloud technology, and report those plans to OMB/NSC, per Section 3 of the Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, is **July 11, 2021**."
