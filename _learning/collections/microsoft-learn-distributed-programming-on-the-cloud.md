title: "Distributed programming on the cloud"
excerpt: "Learn about how complex computer programs must be architected for the cloud by using distributed programming.\nIn this module, you will:\n\nClassify programs as sequential, concurrent, parallel, and distributed\nIndicate why programmers usually parallelize sequential programs\nDefine distributed programming models\nDiscuss the challenges with scalability, communication, heterogeneity, synchronization, fault tolerance, and scheduling that are encountered when building cloud programs\nDefine heterogeneous and homogenous clouds, and identify the main reasons for heterogeneity in the cloud\nList the main challenges that heterogeneity poses on distributed programs, and outline some strategies for how to address such challenges\nState when and why synchronization is required in the cloud\nIdentify the main technique that can be used to tolerate faults in clouds\nOutline the difference between task scheduling and job scheduling\nExplain how heterogeneity and locality can influence task schedulers\n\nIn partnership with Dr. Majd Sakr and Carnegie Mellon University."
