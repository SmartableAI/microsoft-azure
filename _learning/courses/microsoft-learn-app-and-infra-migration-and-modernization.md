title: "Applications and infrastructure migration and modernization"
excerpt: "Every modern business is powered by applications, such as internal procurement applications, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, retail websites, and third-party products. As your business prepares for digital transformation, it’s important to begin modernizing and migrating your applications and infrastructure to the cloud. Azure is a key component of that process. You can choose to migrate, modernize, or build cloud native solutions depending on your business goals and how you assess your application portfolio. This is a strategic decision. You’ll be able to choose the path that’s right for your organization."
