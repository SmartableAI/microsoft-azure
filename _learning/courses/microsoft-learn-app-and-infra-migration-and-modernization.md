excerpt: "Every modern business is powered by applications, such as internal procurement applications, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, retail websites, and third-party products.

You can choose to migrate, modernize, or build cloud native solutions depending on your business goals and how you assess your application portfolio. This is a strategic decision. You’ll be able to choose the path that’s right for your organization."
