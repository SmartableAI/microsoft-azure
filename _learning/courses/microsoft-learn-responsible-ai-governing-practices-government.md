title: "Identify governing practices for responsible AI in government"
excerpt: "As AI becomes more prevalent, it’s imperative that governments have practices in place to ensure that it’s used responsibly. This starts with governments establishing their own guiding principles, then choosing and operationalizing a system of governance. We recognize that every government will have their own perspective on responsible AI, but we’re hopeful that our perspective will serve as a helpful starting point as they embark on their own AI journey."
