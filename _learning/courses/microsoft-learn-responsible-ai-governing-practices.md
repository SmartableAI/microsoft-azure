title: "Identify governing practices for responsible AI"
excerpt: "As AI becomes more prevalent, it’s imperative that organizations have governing practices in place to ensure that it’s used responsibly. Responsible use of AI starts with organizations establishing their own guiding principles, then choosing and operationalizing a system of governance. We recognize that every organization will have their own perspective on responsible AI, but we’re hopeful that our perspective will serve as a helpful starting point as others embark on their own AI journey."
