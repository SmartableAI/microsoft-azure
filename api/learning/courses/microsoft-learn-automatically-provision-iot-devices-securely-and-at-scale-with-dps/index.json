First, you create an IoT Hub, and add the DPS service. Next, an X.509 root certificate, and multiple leaf certificates, are created to handle security. Code for a simulated device is provided. You then link all the pieces together, and verify that your DPS resource works. After completing the module, you should have a good understanding of how to provision Azure IoT devices at scale.","sourceUrl":"https://smartableai.github.io/microsoft-azure/api/learning/courses/microsoft-learn-automatically-provision-iot-devices-securely-and-at-scale-with-dps/index.json","webUrl":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/securely-provision-iot-devices-at-scale-with-device-provisioning-service/","originalUrl":null,"featuredContent":null,"actions":null,"length":"PT57M","ratings":{"count":318,"average":4.6257863},"provider":{"name":"Microsoft Learn","domain":"microsoft.com","images":[{"url":"https://smartableai.github.io/microsoft-azure/assets/images/organizations/microsoft.com-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"publishers":null,"authors":null},"publishedDateTime":null,"levels":["Beginner"],"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":50,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/achievements/iot/automatically-provision-iot-devices-securely-at-scale-with-dps-social.png","width":800,"height":400,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":true}],"content":"\r\n","type":"course","price":"Free","topics":["Azure","IoT"]}
