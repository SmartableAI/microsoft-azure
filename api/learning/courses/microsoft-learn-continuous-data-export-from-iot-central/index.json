You use the scenario from your previously completed \"Create your first Azure IoT Central app\" Learn module, where you controlled a refrigerated truck.

You then build a Power BI app to read and display the telemetry data on a mobile phone.","sourceUrl":"https://smartableai.github.io/microsoft-azure/api/learning/courses/microsoft-learn-continuous-data-export-from-iot-central/index.json","webUrl":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/continuously-export-data-from-iot-central-power-bi/","originalUrl":null,"featuredContent":null,"actions":null,"length":"PT1H9M","ratings":{"count":76,"average":4.5526314},"provider":{"name":"Microsoft Learn","domain":"microsoft.com","images":[{"url":"https://smartableai.github.io/microsoft-azure/assets/images/organizations/microsoft.com-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"publishers":null,"authors":null},"publishedDateTime":null,"levels":["Beginner"],"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":50,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/achievements/iot/continuous-data-export-from-iot-central-social.png","width":640,"height":320,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":true}],"content":"\r\n","type":"course","price":"Free","topics":["Azure","IoT","Storage","Analytics"]}
