{"path":"_learning/courses/microsoft-learn-introduction-to-classical-machine-learning.md","title":"Build classical machine learning models with supervised learning","excerpt":"Supervised learning is a form of machine learning where an algorithm learns from examples of data. We progressively paint a picture of how supervised learning automatically generates a model that can make predictions about the real world. We also touch on how these models are tested, and difficulties that can arise when training them.","sourceUrl":"https://smartableai.github.io/microsoft-azure/api/learning/courses/microsoft-learn-introduction-to-classical-machine-learning/index.json","webUrl":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-classical-machine-learning/","originalUrl":null,"featuredContent":null,"actions":null,"length":"PT52M","ratings":{"count":0,"average":0.0},"provider":{"name":"Microsoft Learn","domain":"microsoft.com","images":[{"url":"https://smartableai.github.io/microsoft-azure/assets/images/organizations/microsoft.com-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"publishers":null,"authors":null},"publishedDateTime":null,"levels":["Beginner"],"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":50,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/achievements/generic-badge-social.png","width":640,"height":320,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":true}],"content":"\r\n","type":"course","price":"Free","topics":["Azure","AI"]}
