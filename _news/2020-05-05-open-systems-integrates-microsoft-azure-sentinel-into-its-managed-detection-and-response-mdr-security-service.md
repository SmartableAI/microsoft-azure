    excerpt: "Microsoft and Intel have recently collaborated on a new research project that explored a new approach to detecting and classifying malware. Called STAMINA (STAtic Malware-as-Image Network Analysis), the project relies on a new technique that converts malware samples into grayscale images and then scans the image for textural and structural patterns specific to malware samples."

  - title: "Microsoft, Intel Combine Deep Learning and Pixels to Nix Malware"
    excerpt: "Microsoft and Intel researchers have found a way to combine artificial intelligence and image analysis to create a highly effective means to combat malicious software infections. The researchers call their approach \"STAMINA\" -- static malware-as-image network analysis -- and say it's proven to be highly effective in detecting malware with a low rate of false positives."
