    excerpt: "Microsoft and Intel have recently collaborated on a new research project that explored a new approach to detecting and classifying malware. Called STAMINA (STAtic Malware-as-Image Network Analysis), the project relies on a new technique that converts malware samples into grayscale images and then scans the image for textural and structural patterns specific to malware samples."
